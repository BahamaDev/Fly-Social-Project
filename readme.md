## Developer's Note:

It took me a while but this was a very rewarding project to complete. I LOVED working on this, because I gleaned significant insight on how popular social media applications work. I also gained a deeper understanding of React component structures and libraries, headless CMSs, and how different authentication tools work. All in all a good project. Now on to the next one!
